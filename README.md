## What is the Patent Tidier Extension?

Patent Tidier is a very basic Chrome Extension that:

* Hides unnecessary sections on Google Patents pages by default on page load.
* Displays an icon in the address bar to allow users to click to toggle visibility of these sections.
* Inserts accompany images into proper places in the patent description sections for better readbility.
* Inserted patent images can be rotated to proper orientation by clicking for better readbility.
