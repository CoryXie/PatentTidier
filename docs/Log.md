## Some development logs

* 1. Inspired by http://39digits.com/create-a-chrome-extension-to-hide-youtube-comments/
* 2. Icons are from http://www.iconarchive.com/show/crystal-clear-icons-by-everaldo/App-clean-icon.html
* 3. For Google Patents, there is <div class="patent-section patent-drawings-section"> which contains 
<span class="patent-section-count"> that can be used to detect the number of patent images for a 
specific patent. In the <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading> there can be several lines
describing the images but not necessarily each of them.
